Marc Canter, CEO of Broadband Mechanics (BBM) is a 25+ year veteran of the software business. BBM is a boutique social networking design and platform shop - specializing in building systems that support the open stack, custom semi-private networks and strategic thinking.  Marc is an advocate of open social networking, open standards and what he calls the â€˜open meshâ€˜. A speaker and panel moderator at many conferences around the world, Marc is not afraid to ask the hard questions which highlight the desire for users to control their own data and software developers to not be locked into web 1.0 strategies.  Marc was the co-founder of MacroMind, which became Macromedia. While with MacroMind Marc helped develop:  - the worldâ€™s first multimedia player - now known as Flash, originally called Shockwave. The original player was the VideoWorkls player - first created in Dec. 1984. Every Macintosh shipped with a player disc from 1986.  - the worldâ€™s first multimedia authoring system. Before MacroMind multimedia was craeted by programming. MacroMind helped introduce (along with Appleâ€™s Hypercard) the notion of end-user â€˜authoringâ€˜ - where a simple scripting langauge and a timeline notional system were utilized to get images, sounds, animations and video synchronized and interactive - over time. First available in 1987.  - the worldâ€™s first cross-platform authoring system - popularizing the notion of â€œauthor once, play back many placesâ€œ. Content developers could create their interactive applications once, and play them back on Macintoshs or PCs. That was back in 1989.  Mentioned in several books, a leading blogger and web personality - Marc is also known as a father of five kids and Reggae enthusiast.  Broadband Mechanics offers a social networking platform called PeopleAggregator in two ways:  - as a SaaS hosted model - where BBM handles all details of running the system  - in source code available form - priced for both startups and enterprises  Broadband Mechanics also offers strategic consulting, design and work for hire build out of customized systems. This notion of a white labeled platforms - is something upon which BBMâ€™s business model is based. BBM believes that many nations, brands and entities will wish to not leave themselves locked up in the vices of the BigCo platforms and control their own destiny.  BBMâ€™s live sites (built with PeopleAggregator) include:  - ROTCLink.com - the U.S. Army ROTC programâ€™s social network (run for MRM Worldwide)  - BellVideoStore.ca - Bell Canadaâ€™s movie downloading site (where we added social features)  - iTimes.com - theTimesofIndiaâ€™s social network  - leamiche.donnamoderna.com - Mondadoriâ€™s Italian womenâ€™s social network (Berlusconi company)  - rocklandNY.tv - a community for citizens of Rockland County, NY  - GTChannnel.com - a drifter car enthusiast scoial network  - Cyama.com - a religious youth site  After leaving Macromedia in 1992 Marc produced an interactive music video band, called the Mediaband (1992-94), the Marc Canter Show (1995) and a cyber theme restaurant operating system - Mediabar (1996-97.)  Marc then co-developed an interactive flat panel display for SuperBowl XXXII (1997-98), a digital city architecture for Trieste, Italy (1998), an IPTV authoring system for NOW.com (1999), was a co-founder of Digiscents (1999) and helped craete numerous other designs and architectures for AOL, Reuters, eCast and other startups throughout the 90â€™s  A complete timeline of Marcâ€™s life can be found here.

In 2013, he co-founded BetterWorks, an enterprise software company dedicated to innovating the field of performance management. BetterWorks is funded by Kleiner Perkins (John Doerr) and Emergence Capital (Jason Green) and serves hundreds of customers. BetterWorks’ next-generation performance management platform empowers employees to seamlessly set goals; provide and receive peer feedback; and conduct regular check-ins with management, all in support of BetterWorks’ mission: Get 1% better every day. Under his leadership, Kris championed a flat, collaborative organizational structure and led the company’s team of managers across the company to 54%/46% male to female gender mix — this virtual parity is a rarity in the traditionally male-dominated enterprise tech space and more than twice the industry standard. Kris Duggan left his day-to-day role at BetterWorks in 2017, having shepherded the company past the 100-employee mark and overseeing the acquisition of more than 250 enterprise customers. Kris continues to serve on the company’s board and remains committed to supporting its next phases of growth. He is presently focused on the boundless promise of the healthtech sector. In the years to come, he looks forward to identifying and making targeted investments in the next crop of promising startups in this life-saving and life-improving field.

Badgeville was acquired in 2016 by publicly traded Callidus ((later bought by SAP) in a successful exit that validated their early efforts and underscored the transformative power of gamification. Over the last two decades in Silicon Valley, Kris has had the great honor to invest in and work with many amazing startups and teams, including Palantir Technologies, RelateIQ (acquired by Salesforce.com), Addepar, Blend Labs, Gusto, Turo, and WebEx (acquired by Cisco).

Kris currently invests in a number of early-stage firms, including Gusto (a payroll, benefits, and HR automation platform); Blend (an enterprise software provider that empowers top mortgage lenders to be more efficient, compliant, and borrower-friendly); and Addepar, an investment management technology company.

       " \"I love to think of entrepreneurs as heros of a sort.To imagine a single person that starts with a simple idea and then turns that idea into a permanent monument of human accomplishment - that is beautiful.To imagine a single human being having the guts to hold themselves responsible for affecting so many lives through employment, through their product and through the shear, raw, and direct power of money - that is my kind of benevolence. To see a person stand up and attempt greatness in the face of such overwhelming mediocrity in today's world - that is courage. I have seen the best and the worst that being an entrepreneur can offer. I've seen revenues grew from $20 million to over $3.6 billion. I've ridden the roller coaster of going public seeing our stock rise by 856% only to come crashing back down by 900%. I've taken on Google at their height of power and convinced 72 other to join me. I've made many decisions that made people love me, but more importantly I made a few difficult calls that I knew were right even though I knew it would make some hate me. Regardless of the perils, the risks and the loneliness that entrepreneurs often face, I know that my path is to create, to build and to take something that perhaps only I can see and make it work. It is ingrained my bones and my heart. I am a capitalist and I am an entrepreneur. To me, there is hardly anything more difficult, more worthy or more inspiring than being a founder.What defines us is that despite the risks, the fears and the fact that almost all who try fail, we, by our own volition, start companies with the intent of changing the world.  And we do so not as the consumers or dependancies of the initial spark that ultimately creates value, but rather as the producers, the irreducible primaries, of it.  As such, our evolutionary path, our successes and our failures, not only affects us, but also radiates out to the entire startup ecosystem with which we share co-dependencies. Yet, despite the importance of our quest, our path is rarely made easier by our own kind.  We, the founder cognoscenti, are so rapt with our own efforts that we rarely lift our head, or rather our minds to help our own brethren.  We, the great producers of value, seem to flip becoming the consumer of knowledge rather than the producer of it.  As a result, we unwittingly end up stifling our brethren instead of helping them in ways that seem obvious.  While founders may have no formal leader, no formal structure and our borders may be unbound by geography, doctrine or rules, we are, in fact, a community.  To create a shared sense of our current state through the fearless act of sharing knowledge or taking a position is what binds us together.  To do so declares our state and consummates our union.  To repudiate such an attempt abdicates our responsibility to one another, contradicts our nature as producers and inures us to a solitary existence where we set ourselves adrift in what is already tempestuous waters. In a world which irrationally values quips over explanations, summation over detail, kind of getting it versus really getting it, it is essential to recognize the need for depth when depth is necessary.  So however long, flawed or perilous my essays and writings may be, and even though my wife has grave concerns for the english language when put in my hands, if just one founder is able to extract a single shred of knowledge that completes a circuit, then it was worth it.\",\n",

Known for taking one of the most traditional businesses in America — professional baseball — and redefining its most basic tenets, Beane has leveraged the power of mathematics to manage his team by using sophisticated statistical analysis in addition to traditional ''gut instinct.'' Beane's executive talents and the organization's baseball philosophy were the subject of Michael Lewis' best-selling book ''Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,'' which opened the eyes of many of the top sports executives and business CEOs from any industry or profession in the nation.  The Oakland Athletics have been a perennial postseason contender since Beane took over the general manager's duties in 1998, and in 2006 the team continued its winning ways by advancing to the American League Championship Series. The A's have compiled a 825-632- (.573) record over the last nine seasons, which is the second-best record in the American League and third best in all of baseball during that time frame, won three American League West titles (2000; 2002-03) and secured one AL Wild Card spot (2001). And they have done this all while having one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball.  In addition, Oakland A's players have won numerous individual accolades over the last eight seasons, including two American League Most Valuable Player awards, a pair of AL Rookie of the Year honors and one AL Cy Young Award. The organization's farm system has also flourished under Beane.

Beane joined the A's front office staff in 1990 as the club's major league advance scout. In 1993, he was promoted to the assistant general manager's position. And in late 1997 he assumed the general manager's duties.  Earlier in his career, he was a first round draft pick (23rd overall) of the New York Mets in the 1980 June Free Agent Draft. He played six major league seasons as an infielder, outfielder and catcher for the Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers and Oakland A's. His final season in uniform was 1989 when he was a utility player on the A's World Championship team. Beane retired as an active player in the spring of 1990.

       " 'Ranked by Forbes Magazine as a “Web Celeb”,Jimmy Donal Wales is a U.S.Internet entrepreneur, wiki pioneer, and technology visionary, who is best known as the Founder of Wikipedia, an international collaborative free content encyclopedia on the Internet, and the Wikimedia Foundation. He is co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web hosting service he set up in 2004. The origins of Wikipedia began in March 2000, when Mr. Wales started Nupedia (“the free encyclopedia”), which was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. With the addition of wikis (a collection of web pages designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content), the project was dubbed “Wikipedia.” Mr. Wales laid down the founding principles and content, establishing an Internet-based community of contributors during that year. Wikipedia was initially intended to be a wiki-based site for collaboration on early encyclopedic content for submission to Nupedia, but Wikipedia’s rapid growth quickly overshadowed Nupedia’s development. In a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Jimmy Wales  explained his motivations about Wikipedia, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.” The success of the project has helped popularize a trend in web development (called Web 2.0) that aims to facilitate creativity, collaboration, and sharing among users. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Jimmy Wales took on the role of the project’s spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances. His work with Wikipedia, which has become the world’s largest encyclopedia, prompted TIME Magazine to name him one of its “100 Most Influential People,” in 2006 in the “Scientists & Thinkers” category. In 2003, Jimmy Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, the 5th most popular website in the world. In 2004, Wales co-founded, with Angela Beesley, the for-profit company Wikia, Inc. Wikia is a wiki farm – a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. As part of his work at Wikia, Inc., Mr. Wales is developing a human-powered search engine, Search Wikia, which will be based on the same open, transparent, community-driven principles of Wikia and Wikipedia. The World Economic Forum recognized Wales as one of the “Young Global Leaders” of 2007. This prestigious award acknowledges the top 250 young leaders across the world for their professional accomplishments, their commitment to society, and their potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world. Jimmy Wales is a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. He serves on the Board of Directors of Socialtext, a provider of wiki technology to businesses and the non-profit organization Creative Commons. Mr. Wales has received an honorary doctorate from Knox College of Illinois and was presented with a Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2006. Jimmy Wales received his bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University and started with the Ph.D. finance program at the University of Alabama, where he left with a Master’s. After that, he took courses offered in the Ph.D. finance program at Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the doctoral dissertation required to earn a Ph.D. From 1994 to 2000, Wales was the research director at Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago.',\n",

While he learned his earliest lessons in leadership and web design from his high school Quake 2 clan and Everquest guild, Alexis continued his official studies at the University of Virginia, where he met his future co-founder Steve Huffman during freshman year move-in day. This would lead to the founding of reddit, which he recounted along with many lessons for entrepreneurs, in his national bestseller, Without Their Permission. At UVA, Alexis majored in business and history with a minor in German. Though he had originally planned to become an immigration lawyer, he experienced an epiphany in his junior year (while sitting in a Waffle House) that led him to the realization that he didn't want to practice law. Instead he convinced his best friend Steve to start a company with him. The pair traveled to Cambridge, MA during their senior year spring break to hear Paul Graham give a talk titled ''How to Start a Startup.'' After the lecture, Alexis invited Graham out for a drink so he and Steve could pitch Graham on their business idea. Graham agreed, loved the idea, and suggested they apply to a new seed stage venture firm he'd launched called Y Combinator. Alexis and Steve's original plan was to build an infrastructure that would allow people to order food from their cell phones. Though the idea was rejected, Alexis and Steve were invited to join the first class of Y Combinator, on the condition that they'd come up with a new concept. The next idea they pitched to Graham would become reddit.com.\",\n",
